## Functional Integration (snifferjs)

### 1. Install snifferjs

```sh
npm install snifferjs
```

### 2. Enable Interception

In `src/lib/`, create (or update) `snifferjs.ts`:

```ts
import snifferjs from "snifferjs";
snifferjs.patchAll();
// Subscribe to snifferjs events and adapt to your InterceptRecord type here.
```

- **Tip:** Replace imports of `snifferjs-mock` with your new `snifferjs` module.

### 3. Hook UI to snifferjs

- Wherever you subscribe to intercepted events (in state/store/hooks), use the real snifferjs listeners.
- Make sure each intercepted event is formatted to your UI's `InterceptRecord` type.

> See [`snifferjs` docs](https://github.com/cyphunk/snifferjs) for detailed API.

## Making It a Browser Extension

### 1. Prepare Chrome Manifest

Create `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Jabberwocky",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "permissions": ["scripting", "activeTab", "storage"],
  // ...other required fields...
}
```

- _Load your built `/dist` as "Unpacked" at `chrome://extensions`._

### 2. Inject and enable snifferjs

- Inject your code so `snifferjs.patchAll()` runs as soon as possible in the extension.

### 3. Use Dashboard as Popup

- The dashboard React UI becomes your extension popup/option page.
