> **Project repo name:** _Please rename this repository to `Jabberwocky` on GitHub for contest eligibility and clarity!_

## Overview

Jabberwocky is a privacy-first utility that intercepts and obfuscates personally identifiable information (PII) from your browser‚Äîbefore it can leave your computer. Inspired by the recent changes to Chromium (June 2024) that broke traditional ad blockers and privacy extensions, Jabberwocky aims to fill the gap with a transparent, 100% local solution.

**Built with:**  
- [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) (AI-powered app builder)  
- OpenAI (for rapid prototyping and guidance)

## üöÄ Demo

<!-- Replace `demo.gif` with your actual demo GIF file after creating it! -->
![Jabberwocky Demo](screenshots/demo.gif)

**How to make this demo GIF:**
1. **Record** your screen (try QuickTime on Mac, Xbox Game Bar/ShareX on Windows, Peek on Linux).
2. **Show key features:** Toggle protection on/off, let logs stream in, export CSV, clear log, open extension modal.
3. **Convert** the video `.mp4` to GIF using [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif/) or similar. Trim/crop as needed.
4. **Save** as `screenshots/demo.gif` and commit to your repo.
5. Update this README to show your real GIF!

## Features

- **Real-time PII Interception log**: See what personal data is getting sent out of your browser and how it's scrambled.
- **Toggle Protection**: Instantly enable/disable PII shielding.
- **Detailed listing**: Visualize what data is intercepted (userAgent, location, cookies, POST data, etc).
- **Export and Clear Logs**: Download CSV or clear log at any time.
- **Beautiful UI**: Fully responsive, modern look.
- **100% Local**: No cloud, no login, no tracking.

## Privacy Threats Jabberwocky Prevents

- Browser fingerprinting (userAgent, navigator)
- Geolocation data leaks (window.location, APIs)
- Cookie/session hijacking or accidental server leaks
- Form data sniffing (POSTed emails, real names, tokens)
- Analytics/tracker access to unique identifiers
- Unintended third-party POST/GET transmission of PII
- Leaky referer headers exposing where you came from
- Language/locale profiling to deduce identity or region
- Device/OS fingerprinting

---

## Future-Proof & Extensible

- Extend to new PII types as threats arise (add `snifferjs` listeners)
- User-selectable shield levels (strict/medium/custom)
- Custom spoofing rules by category (e.g., force cookies ‚Üí anonymous)
- Supports new browsers (Chrome, Edge‚Äîcould add more)
- Could power accessibility/privacy content overlays
- Easily add logging for new sensitive fields (phone, address, biometrics)

## Next Steps: Full Functionality & Extension

**Snifferjs Integration Checklist**
- [ ] Install `snifferjs` (`npm install snifferjs`)
- [ ] Import and initialize snifferjs as early as possible
- [ ] Replace `src/lib/snifferjs-mock.ts` with real snifferjs event listeners
- [ ] Map snifferjs events to `InterceptRecord` format
- [ ] Test with different types of outbound PII

**Make a Chrome/Edge Extension**
- [ ] Add a valid `manifest.json` (Manifest V3)
- [ ] Grant permissions for scripts, API interception
- [ ] Set this React dashboard as the popup/option page
- [ ] Test extension in dev mode (`chrome://extensions`)
- [ ] Package and (optionally) submit to extension store

## How Does It Work?

- By default, this app simulates interception of data (for the contest version‚Äîactual interception is not yet functional).
- The plan is to **integrate [snifferjs](https://github.com/cyphunk/snifferjs)** for real PII interception. See below!

## How I Built This Project

Created in days using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) with the help of OpenAI‚Äôs code-completion and chat feature:

- **UI design:** Lovable + Tailwind + shadcn/ui library
- **OpenAI:** Used to suggest React patterns, design strategies, and to break development into manageable steps.
- **Rapid iteration:** Lovable‚Äôs chat-based ‚ÄúAI edit‚Äù workflow handled boilerplate, refactors, and even layout fine-tuning live.
- **Integration discovery:** Lovable/OpenAI were used to plan the snifferjs integration below.

## Roadmap: Integrating snifferjs

To make Jabberwocky fully functional (beyond mock/demo), follow these steps:

1. **Install snifferjs**
   ```sh
   npm install snifferjs
   ```
   Or [clone/fork snifferjs](https://github.com/cyphunk/snifferjs) and bring its core logic into the `/lib` directory for deeper customization.

2. **Inject snifferjs in your extension/app**
   - In the browser extension popup: inject and activate snifferjs‚Äôs API-patching as soon as possible in the page lifecycle.
   - For this React app, call snifferjs‚Äôs interception methods instead of (or in addition to) the existing mock logic in `src/lib/snifferjs-mock.ts`.

3. **Replace Mock Events**
   - Where the code currently emits demo records, subscribe to real snifferjs events (documented in the snifferjs repo).

4. **Connect to UI**
   - Send real intercepted PII/device events into the React state (`records`), ideally preserving the same `InterceptRecord` type.

5. **Permissions (Extension)**
   - Prepare a `manifest.json` with permissions suitable for content scripts (see snifferjs docs).
   - Use the dashboard UI as the main popup UI.
   - Add extension boilerplate for Chrome/Edge distribution.

6. **Testing & Privacy**
   - Ensure all logic runs _locally only_. No cloud events, tracking, or remote logging‚Äîby design!

7. **Publish**
   - Update README with any new extension install or usage steps as you progress.

## Running Locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Making It a Browser Extension

- See the [snifferjs](https://github.com/cyphunk/snifferjs) README for guidance on injection.
- Use this dashboard as your extension‚Äôs popup or options page.
- Adjust `manifest.json` as needed (`manifest v3` for modern Chrome/Edge).
